# Closures

### Understanding how closures works

[Read the code here](./closures.js)

Notes about Closures:

- we dont create closures, it simply happens automatically in some situations and our work is to recognize it.
- closure makes a function remember all the variables that existed at the function's birthplace
- Whenever you create a function within another function, you have created a closure. The inner function is the closure. This closure is usually returned so you can use the outer functionâ€™s variables at a later time.
